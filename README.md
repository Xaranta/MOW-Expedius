# MOW-Expedius


During my Principles of Software Engineering class, we were split into teams and tasked with developing a solution to help handle Meals On Wheels Palm Beach's day to day logistics. The objective was to create an app that would help their volunteers navigate their delivery routes and log relevant data, as well as allow admins to computerize and manage their clientsâ€™ information. 
For this project I took the role of Product Owner. Some of the responsibilities that came with this were:

  Consulting with the client to define the key functional and non functional requirements of the system.
  Defined the general architecture of the system.
  Defining the data schemas we would use to implement the system, as well as which technologies and languages we would use
  We attempted to utilize the AGILE and Scrum methodologies to move the project through the Software development lifecycle, but this proved to be a challenge with none other four members on my team accepting the role of Scrum Master. 

By myself, I was able to impment several of the key system requirements such as building a simple and intuitive UI, integrating the Google Maps JavaScript API, loading addresses into the API from our database, asynchronously editing the database from the site, and the login/registration system. 
The technologies and languages I used to develop MOW Expedius included: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, AJAX, JSON, Google Maps JavaScript API, Balsamic Upwave.io
