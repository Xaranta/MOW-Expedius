# MOW-Expedius

This was a project I worked on for my Software Engineering Class at FAU. 

My team and I created a tool that helped volunteers drive to their clients’ location and document logistical issues.  This facilitated the managers in directing volunteers on their delivery routes.

Technologies implemented in the web app: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX, Google Maps JavaScript API, PHP, PDO, MySQL.
